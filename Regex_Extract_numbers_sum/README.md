<h1>Finding Numbers in a Haystack</h1>

In this program you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. You will extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers.

<h2>Data Files</h2>
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

<a href='http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_42.txt'> Sample data</a> (There are 90 values with a sum=445833).

<a href='http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_1919214.txt'> Actual data </a> (There are 80 values and the sum ends with 654).

These links open in a new window. Make sure to save the file into the same folder as you will be writing your Python program.
